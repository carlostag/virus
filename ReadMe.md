# üß© pSEIRS Virus Propagation Simulator

Interactive **Streamlit web app** to simulate the *probabilistic SEIRS (pSEIRS)* model of virus or epidemic propagation with **latency** and **temporary immunity**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time simulation of **S‚ÄìE‚ÄìI‚ÄìR** compartments using a Runge‚ÄìKutta 4th order (RK4) integrator.
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Infection, recovery, death, and immunity rates.
  - Probabilistic immunity (`p`) and latency (`œâ`) delays.
  - Initial compartment fractions and simulation duration.
- Instant plot of compartment evolution.
- Dynamic key metrics: infection peak, recovery fraction, and equilibrium sum.

## üß† Model Overview

The **pSEIRS model** extends the classical SEIR epidemiological model by including:
- **Delayed transitions** (latency `œâ`, immunity `œÑ`),
- **Temporary immunity** (parameter `p`),
- And **probabilistic reinfection**.

It‚Äôs inspired by:
> M.S.S. Khan (2014). *A Computer Virus Propagation Model Using Delay Differential Equations with Probabilistic Contagion and Immunity.*
